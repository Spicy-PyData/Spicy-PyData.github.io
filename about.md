My Name is **Uzoma Uzosike**. I am a Data scientist and Machine learning enthusiast.
I have completed Master's Degree in Business Information Systems at Mersin University Turkey, and I am currently enrolled in a second Master's Degree in Business Intelligence and Business Analytics at the University of Applied Sciences, Neu-Ulm, Germany.
My major field of interest is Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Text Analytics and Programming in Python.
Most of my time is spent on acquiring knowledge to continuously improve my skill-set as a data scientist.
